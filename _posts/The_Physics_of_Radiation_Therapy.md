## Chapter 1: Structure of Matter
All matter is composed of individual entities called elements. These matters are made of atom, which consist of nucleus and electron clouds. Nucleus is made of protons
and neutrons while electron clouds have electons orbiting around the nucleus.

The atom consists of different energy levels where there exist electrons. Electrons emit radiation when they move to lower energy level 
because of conservation of energy. The atomic energy levels are labeld with K, M, N, and O depending on distance from the nucleus. The binding energy of electrons 
depends on the Coulomb force of attraction between the nucleus and electrons.

## Chapter 2: Nuclear Transformations
Radioactivity is a phenomenon in which radiation is given off by the nuclei of the elements.
