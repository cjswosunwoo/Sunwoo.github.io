# The Physics of Radiation Therapy
## Chapter 1: Structure of Matter
All matter is composed of individual entities called elements. These matters are made of atom, which consist of nucleus and electron clouds. Nucleus is made of protons
and neutrons while electron clouds have electons orbiting around the nucleus.

The atom consists of different energy levels where there exist electrons. Electrons emit radiation when they move to lower energy level 
because of conservation of energy. The atomic energy levels are labeld with K, M, N, and O depending on distance from the nucleus. The binding energy of electrons 
depends on the Coulomb force of attraction between the nucleus and electrons.

## Chapter 2: Nuclear Transformations
Radioactivity is a phenomenon in which radiation is given off by the nuclei of the elements. 
One of the particles might gain enough energy to overcome the potential barrier and escape the nucleus and the nucleus achieve a state of lower energy. 
Then the nucleus will become unstable and will emit particles/radiation until it reaches a stable state. As the nucleus radiates energy, it will lose mass due to E=mc^2.
Half-life is the time required for either the activity or the number of radioactive atoms to decay to half the initial value. 

There are different modes of radioactive decay
1. Alpha Particle Decay
2. Beta Particle Decay

### Nuclear Reactions
Nuclear reactions can be produced by bombarding heavier nuclides with lighter nuclides or particles. 
1. Proton Bombardment
2. Deuteron Bombardment
3. Neutron Bombardment
4. The alpha, n Reaction

Photodisintegration is an interaction of a high-energy photon with an atomic nucleus leading to a nuclear reaction and emission of one or more nucleons.
