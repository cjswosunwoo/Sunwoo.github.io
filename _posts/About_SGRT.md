# Clinical paradigms and challenges in surface guided radiation therapy: Where do we go from here?

## Important Acronyms
* SGRT- Surface Guided Radiation Therapy
* RTT- Radiation Therapy Technologists
* QMP- Qualified Medical Physicist
* CBCT- cone-beam CT
* FOV- Field of View

## Evolving mutidisciplinary roles
As SGRT is new to the radiation therapy system, the clinical team needs specific training to move from original 3 point view system to SGRT system.
The qualified medical physicist(QMP) is responsible to instruct users such as RTT

## Dualities
### patient positioning(3-point vs. SGRT)
SGRT
1. doesn't require tattoos which are needed for 3-point localization. 
2. provides 3D visualization of the patient's posture and topographical information
3. can rotate, which allows the patients' position to be corrected prior to verification imaging or treatment

2D x-ray imaging
1. corrections carried out predominantly along planes perpendicular to the imaging direction without indicators of any potential rotations and deformations in the patient setup

SGRT is useful in positioning breast cancer b/c: 
1. the surface is an adequate surrogate for the target volume in the case of whole breast
2. extended FOV of SGRT enables correction of the patient's arm position

However, treatment volume using SGRT isn't very useful for abdomen and pelvis
