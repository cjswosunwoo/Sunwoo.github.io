# Clinical paradigms and challenges in surface guided radiation therapy: Where do we go from here?

## Important Acronyms
* SGRT- Surface Guided Radiation Therapy
* RTT- Radiation Therapy Technologists
* QMP- Qualified Medical Physicist
* CBCT- cone-beam CT
* FOV- Field of View
* IGRT- Image Guided Radiotherapy

## Evolving mutidisciplinary roles
As SGRT is new to the radiation therapy system, the clinical team needs specific training to move from original 3 point view system to SGRT system.
The qualified medical physicist(QMP) is responsible to instruct users such as RTT

## Dualities
### patient positioning(3-point vs. SGRT)
SGRT
1. doesn't require tattoos which are needed for 3-point localization. 
2. provides 3D visualization of the patient's posture and topographical information
3. can rotate, which allows the patients' position to be corrected prior to verification imaging or treatment

2D x-ray imaging
1. corrections carried out predominantly along planes perpendicular to the imaging direction without indicators of any potential rotations and deformations in the patient setup

SGRT is useful in positioning breast cancer b/c: 
1. the surface is an adequate surrogate for the target volume in the case of whole breast
2. extended FOV of SGRT enables correction of the patient's arm position

However, treatment volume using SGRT isn't very useful for abdomen and pelvis b/c surface doesn't always correlate well with the internal
treatment volume in the abdomen and pelvis. It's better to combine SGRT and IGRT in this case.

### IGRT vs. SGRT/IGRT
IGRT- encompasses any imaging technique that's used for anatomical or functional localization and response assessment in the treatment room
Most widely used IGRT technique is CBCT but non-ionizing imaging modalities such as transabdominal 3D ultra-sound imaging and MRI are also used for
IGRT. These provide additional benefits due to their real-time imaging capabilities and superior soft tissue contrast particulary in the case of MRI.

SGRT is the only modality that combines both: 
* imaging without dose 
* real-time feedback
* sub-millimeter spatial resolution in 3D
* largest FOV available in radiotherapy.

These caracteristics enable SGRT to verify:
* immobilization accuracy
* correct patient's posture
* track the respiratory state
* provide intra-fraction monitoring(used to augment 3D volumetric imaging workflows)

### Standardization vs Individualization of Workflows

### Patient safety vs. a new source of risk

### Big data vs. too much data

## Harnessing the synergy between research and clinical practice

### Potential new SGRT applications
