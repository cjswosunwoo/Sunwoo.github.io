# The reason why I'm starting this blog

I've decided to start a blog to share my process of improving my python skills and gaining knowledge in information theory. 
As a physics major, I've only had coding experience with solving mathematical problems such as differential equations and creating physics simulations. Now, I realized
I could do much more with programming.
We are now able to create machines that could not only replace human labor, but also our ability to think and process thanks to machine learning and deep learning. 
These methods copy our brain's information processing thanks to the development of Artificial Neural Networks and its applications towards real life problems. We are now
living in a world where we cannot live without these machines. However, we are still very far away to create an artificial brain that can be identical with our biological
brain. Yet we want to create it.
I believe the key to understanding our biological brain and creating an artifical brain is in understanding the behavior of information in mathematical and physical sense.
This is why I am planning on learning information theory.
