# Clinical evaluation of interfractional variations for whole breast radiotherapy using 3-dimensional surface imaging

## definitions
WBRT- whole breast radiotherapy
PBI- partial breast irradiation
DVH- dose volume histogram
inter- between
intra-within
ROI- region of interest
## Introduction

Our study aims to evaluate whether standard-fractionated WBRT could be improved with better alignment techniques or are our current conventional alignment techniques sufficient for whole breast radiotherapy
The aim of this investigation is to investigate:
1. the daily clinical performance of AlignRT system for breast alignment
2. the absolute displacements between setup with lasers and skin marks and setup with the 3D surface-based imaging system
3. dosimetric effect of daily alignments with skin marks vs 3D surface-based aligments for WBRT patients
